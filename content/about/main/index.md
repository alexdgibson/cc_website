intro: This is my personal website! I've just started a monthly blog series called 'Curiosity Chronicles'. I'll keep updates on some interesting projects (to me at least), the trials and tribulations of my PhD and some randomness! <br><br>
  
  My background is in Biomedical Science (anatomy, physiology and biochemistry). As an avid runner, I then completed an MPhil, predicting and modelling elite sports. Now, continuing to follow my curiosities I'm completing a PhD in medical statistics. My PhD focuses on meta-research in clinical prediction models, examining poor statistical practices. <br><br>
  
  My interests are in meta-research, medicine, statistics and research-integrity.
