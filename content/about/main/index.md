intro: This is my personal website! I have my blog series 'Curiosity Chronicles'. I keep updates on some meta-scientific projects, my PhD with a focus on science communication! <br><br>
  
  I have an undergrad in Biomedical Science and a MPhil in satistical modelling in high-performance sport. Now, I am a current PhD candidate in medical statistics. My PhD focuses on meta-research in clinical prediction models, examining poor statistical and research practices. <br><br>
  
  My interests are in research integrity, meta-science, medicine, sport and statistics.
