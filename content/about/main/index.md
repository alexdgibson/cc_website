intro: This is my personal website! I have my monthly blog series 'Curiosity Chronicles'. I'll keep updates on some interesting projects (to me at least), the trials and tribulations of my PhD and some randomness! <br><br>
  
  I have an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Science and a MPhil in elite sport performance. Now, I'm completing a PhD in medical statistics. My PhD focuses on meta-research in clinical prediction models, examining poor statistical practices. <br><br>
  
  My interests are in research integrity, meta-science, medicine, sport and statistics.
