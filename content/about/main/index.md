  This is my personal website! Through this site I've started a monthly blog series called 'DISTRIBUTIONS'. I'll keep updates on my any personal and potentially interesting projects, the trials and tribulations of my PhD and some randomness!
  
  My background and undergrad is in Biomedical Science (Anatomy, Physiology and Biochemistry). I was then ran about by exercise and completed a MPhil, predicting and modelling elite sport. During this time I also ran 13 ultra/marathons and finished three triathlons. Now I'm deep into statistics. My PhD focuses on meta-research in clinical prediction models, examining poor statistical practices in published models.
