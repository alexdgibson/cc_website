  This is my personal website! I've just started a monthly blog series called 'Distributions'. I'll keep updates on some interesting projects (to me at least), the trials and tribulations of my PhD and some randomness!
  
  My background and undergrad is in Biomedical Science (Anatomy, Physiology and Biochemistry). I was then ran about by exercise science and completed a MPhil, predicting and modelling elite sports. As an avid runner, in that period I ran 13 ultra/marathons and finished three triathlons. Now, continuing to follow my curiosity I'm deep into medical statistics. My PhD focuses on meta-research in clinical prediction models, examining poor statistical practices.
  
  My broad interests span, medical sciences, statistics and high-performance sport. With personal interests in rockets, chemistry, art, coding, reading and everything in between!
