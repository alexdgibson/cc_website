I got to experience my first insight of ‘meta-research’ at the 2023 [AIMOS conference](https://aimos.community/). Before this, I had almost no knowledge about meta-research. It sparked an interest in me for integrity and good research practices. Often meta-research can appear pessimistic or cynical of broader research, showcasing the flaws and faults. Making it nice to see a dedicated session for ‘some good news’ at AIMOS 2024. Four talks presented by [David Mellor](https://www.cos.io/team/david-mellor), [Tammy Hoffman](https://bond.edu.au/profile/tammy-hoffmann), [Ivan Oransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/) and [Anita Brandrowski](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/anita.bandrowski) gave light to the progress and positive affects meta-research and open science is having on the wider research policy and change. I found it very uplifting. The steady growth of articles relating to 'meta-research' is also promising (Figure 1).

As an early PhD student, I was finishing high school only six years ago. I’m positioned to with roughly four decades or so of research to come. This fills me with optimism. Especially, as students much like myself are becoming more and more interested in meta-research. New researchers will help to expand and grow the discipline, bringing new ideas and future outcomes. [Joan Leach](https://cpas.anu.edu.au/people/professor-joan-leach), a plenary speaker at AIMOS 2024 put it perfectly, that “undergraduates need touch points with meta-research from day one”. Involving students early opens opportunities and pathways to engage with meta-research. It worked for me. 


But before a student can decide if they're interested, they must first know about meta-research. This means getting meta-research in front of new students. Simply, an opportunity arose for me to help with the set up / audio-visuals at the 2023 AIMOS conference. My curiosity and interest were brought about from talks by [Eugenie Reich](https://eugeniereichlaw.com/), [Danielle Oste](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielle-oste-35194729b/?originalSubdomain=au) and [Carl Bergstrom](https://ctbergstrom.com/index.html). A particular talk by [Laure Wynants](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/l-wynants) on clinical prediction models was one I found incredibly insightful, leaving my mind conjuring a plethora of potential research questions and ideas. Part of my interest sparked then has developed into my PhD. I believe involving and disseminating topics of meta-research to students will be one of the key drivers in expanding the community of researchers. 

**How do we involve new students?**

Most obvious is to increase the number of honours, MPhil and PhD projects that are focused on meta-research (easier said than done). Providing the opportunity for students to pursue their interests. However, this would only be possible for those already established researchers who can provide the resources to students. Lectures, workshops or conferences would be great in engaging a larger number of students. Increasing the availability or promotion of these events could be beneficial. Or even start some form of new content whether that be a blog or podcast. A month ago this series didn't exist, yet here you are reading a dedicated blog to this. 

I'm hopeful for the future of meta-research and the practical impacts it will have on policy and practice.
