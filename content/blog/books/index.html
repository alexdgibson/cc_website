<p>The Greek philosopher Zeno was given the advice; “to live the best life, you should have conversations with the dead”. Books facilitate these conversations. Many of my best ideas and personal philosophies have come directly from such conversations. The following is a non-exhaustive list of a few books that have shaped me in recent years, that you may find of interest.

<h3>1. War Doctor: Surgery On The Front Line – David Nott</h3>
<p>While my interest in medicine came from a documentary I saw in 2018, this is the book that I keep coming back to. Raw, intense, unfiltered stories recounting the brutality of war and one man’s attempt to bring some peace back into the world. You hear both the absolute heartlessness of humans at war before the most selfless, admirable and brave actions of Dr David Nott and other volunteer medical personnel.

<h3>2. Meditations – Marcus Aurelius</h3>
<p>The most powerful man in the world circa 170 AD, Marcus Aurelius was a Stoic philosopher and the last of the five good Roman Emperors. The Meditations are a collection of writings from Marcus to himself to facilitate a discussion of self-improvement and self-guidance in his position of power. Each time I have read the Meditations it has always dawned on me just how little the real challenges of life have changed over thousands of years. There is always something to learn from the Meditations that is applicable to everyday life.

<h3>3. Man’s Search for Meaning – Victor Frankl</h3>
<p>The psychologist Victor Frankl, is taken as a prisoner of war and sent to Nazi concentration camps during World War II. Man’s search for meaning is an incredible retelling of his experiences and the importance of hope and purpose. As a psychologist he saw firsthand how people responded to the evil and those who found purpose fared better.

After Sir Ernest Shackleton’s ship, The Endurance, got wedged between two ice flows, eventually sinking, the 27 men disembarked the ship on a new mission of survival. What follows is the greatest true story of determination and a show case of the indomitable human spirit in a quest to survive. After more than two years stranded in the Antarctic, all men survived, but not without struggle.

<h3>5. Mastery – Robert Greene</h3>
<p>To sum up Mastery, unless you are the genius prodigy, you must surrender to the process of lifelong learning. Nothing truly worthwhile is easy and there are actionable steps to achieve goals and outcomes. In finding the overlap between your interests, passions and what you have potential to be good at, you can then go all in, and in that process is where you can find purpose.

<h3>7. The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness – Morgan Housel</h3>
<p>Financial literacy is increasingly becoming one of the most valuable skills to me. The Psychology of Money takes view on both the logical and emotional aspects of money.

<h3>8. Love Stories – Trent Dalton</h3>
<p>If there has been one book for understanding the breadth of love, this is the one. Maybe I felt a connection with this book as the stories are written by Brisbane locals, sat at a Kmart table, beside the bus stop I got off for the first three years of university. Regardless, there has not been another book that has moved me as much and changed my perspective on the understanding of love. Each chapter is a different perspective, story and understanding of love through the lived experiences of unique people.<br />
