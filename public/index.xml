      <description>At the end of my MPhil I had completed a great deal of work. But I was left wondering my stats. How many hours did I put into this? How many words did I write? How many words did I read? Or, how much caffeine did I consume?&#xA;Given I was continuing with a PhD I thought it will be easy enough to track my coffee consumption. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing for the last three months.</description>
