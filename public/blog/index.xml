      <description>The Greek philosopher Zeno was given the advice; “to live the best life, you should have conversations with the dead”. Books facilitate these conversations. Many of my best ideas and personal philosophies have come directly from such conversations. The following is a non-exhaustive list of a few books that have shaped me in recent years, that you may find of interest. 1.&#x9;War Doctor: Surgery On The Front Line – David Nott&#xD;While my interest in medicine came from a documentary I saw in 2018, this is the book that I keep coming back to.</description>

      <description>For most of my adult life, friends and I have talked about the addictive and negative aspects of social media. A constant highlight reel with individualised targeted ads, an algorithm designed to maximise engagement, not to mention infinite scrolling. Previously, having tried removing social media sporadically with little luck, I’ve now permanently deleted Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, TikTok, X and deactivated my Facebook account.&#xA;For a week back in December, I aimed to spend as little time on my phone as possible and managed less than one hour a day.</description>

      <title>Optimism in Meta-Research</title>

      <description>I got to experience my first insight of ‘meta-research’ at the 2023 AIMOS conference. Before this, I had almost no knowledge about meta-research. It sparked an interest in me for integrity and good research practices. Often meta-research can appear pessimistic or cynical of broader research, showcasing the flaws and faults, which made it refreshing to see a dedicated session for ‘some good news’ at AIMOS 2024. Four talks presented by David Mellor, Tammy Hoffman, Ivan Oransky and Anita Bandrowski gave light to the progress and positive effects meta-research and open science is having on the wider research.</description>

      <description>At the end of my MPhil, I had completed a great deal of work. But I was left wondering some stats… How many hours did I put into this? How many words did I write? How many words did I read? Or how much caffeine did I consume?&#xA;Given I was continuing with a PhD I thought it will be easy enough to track my coffee consumption. And that’s exactly what I’ve been doing for the last three months.</description>
